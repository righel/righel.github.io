First steps with 3D sculpting using Blender.
<!--more-->
Wanted to learn some Blender basics, so I decided to make a 3D model of one of the most famous characters of Luxembourg, Renert, the cunning fox from Michel's Rodange fable.

I used some photos from the Internet from a monument that's in the city center. It took way more than I expected and my wrist hurt a bit after since I did it with a mouse as I don't have a drawing tablet _yet_. Very fun tho!
You can find the 3d model [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4660820). 

Some photos of the project:

Of course the final goal was to make some cool 3d prints of it:

![Renert 3D printed 2]({{ "/assets/renert/renert_printed_2.jpg" | absolute_url }})

![Renert 3D printed 3]({{ "/assets/renert/renert_printed_3.jpg" | absolute_url }})
