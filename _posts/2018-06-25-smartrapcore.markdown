I decided to build a coreXY 3D printer based on a open source design called [SmartrapCore](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:651117), using some sacavanged materials such as Epson printers stepper motors and piece of MDF that I found on the street and a ~30 bucks Ramps 1.6 Kit from Aliexpress that a friend bought.

All the pieces are designed in a parameterized OpenSCAD project which makes very easy to adapt the dimensions to your needs and materials.

To be honest, I was surprised by the results, didn't expected much because used smaller motors than the usual.

It was quite easy to assemble and paying it's respects to the [RepRap philosophy](https://reprap.org/wiki/Philosophy) the machine was quickly printing it's own upgrades.

Yes, it looks like a 3D printer that came out of a Mad Max movie, I didn't have the time yet to beautify it. But it works, that's what matters.

**Some photos and videos of the making of:**

* Used reclaimed MDF panels found of the street to build the frame.

* First mechanical assembly.

* First homing.

* It's alive!

**Some minor upgrades:**

* Made a better bed frame with the help of the CNC.

* Printed it's own new [geared extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1359717) due to the size (small) motor I was using, because it was loosing steps at "high" printing speeds.

* After this point I handed over the printer to my friend Dario and he carried on some aesthetics upgrades.
