For some weird reason my desire to build a CNC router dates my highschool times, when I learned at school to drive stepper motors.

Long time after with some friends we decided to build a CNC router from scratch, using an existing open source design with some personal flavors such as a custom Z-axis designed by me.

The base project was a [RootCNC v3](https://rootcnc.com/machines/root-3/), a relatively simple and inexpensive design.

It was a beautiful project that involved many hours of 3d printing parts and a couple weekends assembling the machine and tweaking it.

The original Z-axis used linear rails which were quite expensive/difficult to get in Argentina, so I decided to design a brand new mechanism from scratch, surprisingly it worked quite well. I used Autodesk Fusion 360 for the design.

Also, instead of using aluminium square pipes we used rectified steel ones, another huge cost saving.
