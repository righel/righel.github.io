I was experiencing overheating issues with my personal laptop, so I decided to address the issue with some 3D printing.

There are several laptop risers in the market, some of them even with built-in coolers. But why would I buy something if I can create it on my own and have fun in the process? Specially in a rainy winter weekend with not much else to do.

I remember I saw somewhere online a minimal design for this but for a macbook, but heck it's a simple thing, so I did it from scratch. Another source of inspiration was the [_cosito de la pizza_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_save) or _pizza saver_, one of our proud inventions among argentinians.

I designed it with Autodesk Fusion 360 and used a Ender 3 Pro for printing the models and white PETG.

Btw, it was kinda tailor made for my Lenovo Thinkpad E460, but if you want you can download the [.step]({{ "/assets/LaptopRiser.step" | absolute_url }}) or [.stl]({{ "/assets/LaptopRiser.stl" | absolute_url }}) files for this.

Some photos and videos of the project:
